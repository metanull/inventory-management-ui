# fix: resolve integration test authentication and type safety issues

## Authentication Fixes
- **Fixed auth store login method calls**: Changed integration tests from passing object `{ email, password, ... }` to separate parameters `(email, password)` to match the actual method signature
- **Improved test isolation**: Added `await authStore.logout()` before authentication failure tests to ensure clean state
- **Resolved HTTP 422 errors**: Fixed malformed authentication requests that were causing "The email field must be a valid email address" errors

## Type Safety Improvements
- **Eliminated `any` types**: Replaced localStorage mock `any` casting with proper `LocalStorageInterface` definition
- **Added proper TypeScript types**: Created explicit interface for localStorage mock with all required methods
- **Fixed array type inference**: Explicitly typed `keys: string[]` to resolve TypeScript compilation issues

## Integration Test Enhancements
- **Cleaner error reporting**: Enhanced error handling to show concise HTTP status messages instead of full error dumps
- **Expected error filtering**: Added console filtering for expected API errors (404, 422) during integration testing
- **Removed prohibited fields**: Eliminated `is_default` field from language creation tests as API doesn't accept it

## Code Quality
- **ESLint compliance**: All linting errors resolved, no warnings about `any` types
- **TypeScript validation**: All type checking passes without errors
- **Test reliability**: All 37 unit tests + 4 integration tests now pass consistently

## Verification
- ✅ Authentication now works correctly with proper bearer token authorization
- ✅ Integration tests handle expected API errors gracefully
- ✅ No type safety issues or `any` type warnings
- ✅ Clean error output without excessive debugging information
- ✅ All tests pass reliably
