# feat: refactor to use @metanull/inventory-app-api-client directly with comprehensive language management

## Summary
Complete refactoring to use the official `@metanull/inventory-app-api-client` TypeScript package directly without wrappers, implementing full CRUD operations for language management with comprehensive testing coverage.

## Key Features
- **Direct API Client Integration**: Replaced custom client with official `@metanull/inventory-app-api-client` package
- **Language Management Suite**: Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for languages
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for language forms with real-time error feedback
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error reporting using global `ErrorDisplay` component
- **Testing Coverage**: Full unit and integration test suites with proper mocking

## Components Implemented
- `Languages.vue`: List view with table display, actions, and modals
- `LanguageDetail.vue`: Detailed view for individual languages
- `LanguageForm.vue`: Dedicated form component for create/edit with validation
- Updated `Home.vue`: Added navigation link to language management

## Technical Improvements
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Disabled `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` for client compatibility
- **Code Quality**: All code passes ESLint and Prettier formatting
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper type definitions
- **Test Coverage**: 37 unit tests + 4 integration tests, all passing

## Store Refactoring
- Direct API client usage in `useLanguageStore`
- Proper error handling with centralized error management
- Reactive state management for languages list and operations

## Testing Infrastructure
- Unit tests with proper mocking of API client and dependencies
- Integration tests with real API connectivity
- Mock localStorage for Node.js environment compatibility
- Error scenario testing and validation testing

## UI/UX Features
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Loading states and error messaging
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Form validation with field-level error display
- Empty state handling

All tests pass, code is formatted, linted, and type-checked successfully.
