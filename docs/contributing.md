# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the Inventory Management UI! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/inventory-management-ui.git
cd inventory-management-ui

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/inventory-management-ui.git
```

### 2. Authenticating for Private GitHub Packages

This project depends on private npm packages hosted on GitHub Packages. You must authenticate with your own GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to install dependencies.

#### ⚙️ Project `.npmrc`

The project-level `.npmrc` contains:

```
@metanull:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

This is safe to commit and does **not** contain any tokens.

#### 🔐 How to Authenticate

1. Generate a GitHub PAT with `read:packages` and `repo` scopes.
2. Add your token to your user-level npm config by running:
   ```powershell
   npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```
   This writes the token to your user `.npmrc` (e.g., `C:\Users\<username>\.npmrc`).

3. You can now run `npm install` and access private packages.

### 🤖 CI/CD Automation

- In CI, set the token as an environment variable (e.g., `NPM_TOKEN`) and inject it at build time.

#### 🛡️ Security Reminder

- **Never commit your token to the repository.**
- Each contributor must use their own token.

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
