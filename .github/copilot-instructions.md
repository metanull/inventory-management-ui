  - Cache data appropriately with reactive state
  - Use TypeScript interfaces for API response types based on OpenAPI specification
    - TypeScript interfaces match the OpenAPI specification
    - OpenAPI specification is used to generate types
  - Uses bearer token authentication
    - API method for obtaining a JWT token is `POST /api/mobile/acquire-token`
